Good day, I hope you're doing well. My name is Rick and I work on the Data Engineering team. I wanted to reach out because I’m very interested in learning more about the engineering team you oversee. I’d love the opportunity to hear more about the team’s focus and whether there might be any current or upcoming openings. If you're open to a quick call, I'd really appreciate the chance to connect.
