Strengthen technical skills and improve operational efficiency through focused learning and workflow
enhancements.

As a Site Reliability Engineer, I will focus on building deeper knowledge in Linux, SQL, and AI over the
course of the year. Alongside that, I'm going to improve a few of our recurring troubleshooting processes to
help reduce manual work and boost team efficiency. This goal will support my growth and contribute to our
broader operational excellence efforts.
Actions

- I will complete intermediate-level training in SQL and Linux by the end of Q2.
- I'll enroll in an AI/ML fundamentals course that's relevant to SRE work (like anomaly detection or predictive
alerting) by Q3.
- I'm going to document and streamline at least two common troubleshooting or operational workflows to help
reduce MTTR.
- I'll take part in at least one team project that focuses on automation or process improvement.

Metrics
- I will complete training and/or knowledge checks for SQL, Linux, and AI courses.
- I'll implement and document two or more process improvements by Q4.
- I'll aim for a 15% reduction in repeat manual troubleshooting tasks or duplicate incidents.

Key Dates
- By June 30: SQL and Linux learning modules will be completed.
- By August 1: I will enroll in the AI course.
- By October 31: I'll complete the AI course.
- By December 15: I'll wrap up and review the process improvement work.
