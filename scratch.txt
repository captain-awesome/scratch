Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Rock, and I’m part of the SRE for Data Engineering team. We work extensively with Tidal and are currently in the process of building applications and Grafana dashboards. To support this effort, we’ve been advised to utilize the Tidal Reporting DB.

I recently received access to the AETH\TidalReportingDB-RO group, and I wanted to reach out for some guidance. Specifically:

    How are you currently logging into this DB instance?
    Which application would you recommend for accessing the reporting database?
    Could you provide a sample SQL statement for querying the snapshot [SNAPSHOT NAME HERE]?

I appreciate any insights you can share. Thanks in advance for your time!

Best,
Rock
