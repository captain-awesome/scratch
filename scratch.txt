Why Goal Setting Is Important
At [COMPANY], we measure annual performance equally based on WHAT we deliver and HOW we achieve results.

Goal setting provides an opportunity to articulate what we need to deliver to advance our Enterprise Strategy and Imperatives. Look to your leader to share their goals and write your own goals that align with the broader strategy of your team and specifically detail your personal contributions and impact.
Setting goals and prioritizing expectations for the year helps all of us to focus our time and effort, recognize our individual contributions to team and enterprise success, and align on expectations. Since business priorities evolve throughout the year, please work with your leader to adjust your goals as necessary.
How we deliver on our goals is equally important. All colleagues are expected to demonstrate our [COMPANY] Heart At Work Behaviors™ and uphold our commitment to ethics and compliance while delivering on their goals. Your leader may prioritize certain Heart At Work Behaviors that must be demonstrated by you and your team throughout the year.
Leaders are responsible for providing performance management feedback based on goal results achieved and demonstration of the Heart At Work Behaviors throughout the year, with more formal assessments at Mid-Year and Year-End.
