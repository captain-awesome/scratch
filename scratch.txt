Thanks for checking in! I did see the survey, and I appreciate the opportunity to share feedback. Since I’m still relatively new to the company, I don’t feel I’ve had enough time or experience to provide meaningful input just yet. I want to ensure any feedback I give is well-informed and constructive, and I don’t want to skew results with incomplete context.

That said, I’m definitely paying attention to my experience here and will be happy to share more thoughtful feedback down the line as I get more settled.

Thanks again for reaching out!
