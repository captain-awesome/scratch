Sorry Rick, I meant to check back in with you yesterday but it was a hectic day. I hear what you are saying as in you feel too new to have a meaningful input on this survey. However I don't think we need to over think it to much here. We wanted our team to have 100% participation in the survey and it applies to new people as well. Its a general survey on how you feel as an employee I know you may not have a strong stance on it today and that's okay. Your opinion may change as time goes on as well, so I don't want you to get too caught up on skewing the grand scheme of things its simply a survey to understand how people are feeling about the company. I know this is something that is important to Bruno and leadership as they are aiming for 100% team engagement on this.
